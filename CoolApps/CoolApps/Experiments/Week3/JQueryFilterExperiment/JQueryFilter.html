            <p>
                This experiment is to study the power of jQuery to filter the DOM elements and fetch the one as required.
                Here, in the left division, I have showed up information related to lot of different types of dances.
                In right division, I have provided different buttons. When clicked, these buttons fetch the dances of their
                own types and display this information below the button pane.
                <br />
                This serves as a powerful tool.

                    <h3>BharatNatyam</h3>
                    <p class="bharatnatyam">
                        Bharata Natyam also spelled Bharatanatyam, is a classical
                        Indian dance form that originated in the temples of Tamil Nadu.This dance form is
                        the product of various 19th- and 20th-century reconstructions of Sadir, the art
                        of temple dancers called Devadasis. It was described in the treatise Natya Shastra
                        by Bharata around the beginning of the common era. Bharata Natyam is known for its
                        grace, purity, tenderness, expression and sculpturesque poses.
                        Lord Shiva is considered the God of this dance form. Today, it is one of the most
                        popular and widely performed dance styles and is practiced by male and female
                        dancers all over the world.

                    <h3>Kathakali</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kathakali is a
                        stylized classical Indian dance-drama noted for the attractive make-up of characters,
                        elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in
                        tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion.
                        It originated in the country's present day state of Kerala during the
                        17th century and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined
                        gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming.

                    <h3>Salsa</h3>
                    <p>
                        Salsa is a popular form of social dance that originated in New York with
                        strong influences from Latin America, particularly Cuba and Puerto Rico.
                        The movements of salsa have its origins in Cuban Son, Cha cha cha, Mambo and
                        other dance forms, and the dance, along with the salsa music, originated i
                        n the mid-1970s in New York.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tango</h3>
                    <p>
                        In flamenco a tango  is one of the flamenco palos closely related in form
                        and feeling to the Flamenco Rumba. It is often performed as a finale to a flamenco tiento.
                        Its compas and llamada are the same as that of the Farruca and share the Farruca's lively nature.
                        However, the tango is normally performed in the A Phrygian mode.

                        The flamenco tango is distinct from the flamenco rumba primarily through the guitar playing.
                        In Rumba the guitar flows more freely, whereas in Tangos the accents on beats 2, 3 & 4 are
                        marked clearly with heavy strumming.

                        Tangos is only vaguely related to Argentine Tango, and objectively they only share compás
                        binario or double stroke rhythm. The fact that Argentine Tango is one of the first couple
                        dances in America has led historians to believe that both could be based in a minuet-style
                        European dance,[1] therefore sharing a common ancestor, while those who compare the present
                        day forms do not see them as related.

                    <h3>Tarantella</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tarantella is a group of various folk dances characterized by a fast upbeat tempo,
                        usually in 6/8 time (sometimes 18/8 or 4/4), accompanied by tambourines.
                        It is among the most recognized forms of traditional southern Italian music.
                        The specific dance-name varies with every region, for instance tammuriata in Campania,
                        pizzica in the Salento region, Sonu a ballu in Calabria. Tarantella is popular in Southern
                        Italy and Argentina.

                    <h3>Ballet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance
                        courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.
                        It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary
                        based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational
                        techniques used in many other dance genres. Ballet requires years of training to learn and
                        master, and much practice to retain proficiency. It has been taught in ballet schools around
                        the world, which have historically used their own cultures to evolve the art.

                    <h3>Syrtos</h3>
                    <p>
                        Syrtos is the collective name of a group of Greek folk dances. Syrtos, along with its
                        relative kalamatianos, are the most popular dances throughout Greece and are frequently
                        danced by the Greek diaspora worldwide. They are very popular in social gatherings, weddings
                        and religious festivals. Syrtos and kalamatianos use the same dance steps, but syrtos is in
                        4/4 time and the kalamatianos is in 7/8 time, organized in a slow (3 beat), quick (2 beat),
                        quick (2 beat) rhythm.

                    <h3>Sirtaki</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sirtaki or syrtaki is a popular[2][3] dance of Greek origin, choreographed by Giorgos
                        Provias for the 1964 film Zorba the Greek.[4] It is not a traditional Greek folkdance,
                        but a mixture of the slow and fast versions of the hasapiko dance. The dance, and the
                        accompanying music by Míkis Theodorakis, are also called Zorbá's dance, Zorbas, or
                        "the dance of Zorba".

                    <h3>Hip Hop</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hip-hop dance refers to street dance styles primarily performed to hip-hop music
                        or that have evolved as part of hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles
                        primarily breaking, locking, and popping which were created in the 1970s and made
                        popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s
                        films Breakin', Beat Street, and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in
                        their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure.
                        The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes
                        called "new style"—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called "jazz-funk".
                        Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to create choreography
                        from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development,
                        hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces.

                    <h3>Bollywood</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term Bollywood was created by combining two names, Bombay (the city now called Mumbai)
                        and Hollywood. Bollywood based in Mumbai (Bombay), is India’s – and the world’s - largest
                        film industry in terms of the number of films produced, and also the number of tickets sold
                        each year. In fact, Bollywood has become so internationally ubiquitous that it now has it’s
