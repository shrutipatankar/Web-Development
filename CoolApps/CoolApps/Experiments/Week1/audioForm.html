        <p>
            This experiment is to view the html5 audio tag. In order to use this tag, I had to avoid using
            .wma formats of audio. It supports .mp3,mp4 and ogg formats. I have created a form, which has
            certain fields. If the field labels are not readable by a Spanish speaking person, he can click
            on the audio button next to the field for the instructions to enter data in the field.
            I have recorded instructions in Spanish langauge and uploaded the audio clips beside the
            respective fields
