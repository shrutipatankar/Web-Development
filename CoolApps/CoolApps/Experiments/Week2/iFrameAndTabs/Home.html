    <p>
        The word Sarpa Mitra mean friends to the snakes. There exist some people who can capture snake
        very comfortably, and instead of harming them, the snakes are left in a sanctury or jungle safely.
        So, what would you do if you see a snake near by your house? I know you would freak out!
        <br />
        But skim through  this website and find out how can you identify a poisonous snake from a distance.
        Also, you can fill out a form next to the snake and a sarpa mitra will reach your door step in 20 mins!

        Remember snakes are part of earth as we humans are. They will try to defend themselves if they feel threatened.
