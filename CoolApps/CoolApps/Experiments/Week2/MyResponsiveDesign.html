            <p>
                This experiment is to study responsive CSS. I have tried this experiment with a single page as well.
                However, the current implementation shows, the screen divided into two different articles.With CSS
                float and margin, padding, and width properties (provided here in percentages as shown below),I could  make
                the CSS responsive. Try to reduce the screen. Both image as well the article gets shorter and shorter.

                    These famous pink birds can be found in warm, watery regions on
                    many continents. They favor environments like estuaries and saline or alkaline lakes.
                    Considering their appearance, flamingos are surprisingly fluid swimmers, but really
                    thrive on the extensive mud flats where they breed and feed.
                    Greater flamingos are likely to be the only tall, pink bird in any given locale.
                    They also have long, lean, curved necks and black-tipped bills with a distinctive downward bend.
                    Their bent bills allow them to feed on small organisms—plankton, tiny fish,
                    fly larvae, and the like. In muddy flats or shallow water, they use their long legs
                    and webbed feet to stir up the bottom. They then bury their bills, or even their entire
                    heads, and suck up both mud and water to access the tasty morsels within.
                    A flamingo's beak has a filterlike structure to remove food from the water
                    before the liquid is expelled.
                    Shrimplike crustaceans are responsible for the flamingo's pink color.
                    The birds pale in captivity unless their diet is supplemented.

                    The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. A typical animal eats half
                    the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day.
                    It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary
                    needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather
                    like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

                    Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China.
                    They may climba
                    as high as 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.

                    Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture.
                    They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers
                    and efficient swimmers.

                    Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense
                    of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring.
                    After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two.
                    The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces (142 grams) at birth and cannot
                    crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white,
                    and develop their much loved coloring later.

                    There are only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild.
                    Perhaps 100 pandas live in zoos, where they are always among
                    the most popular attractions. Much of what we know about pandas comes
                    from study of these zoo animals, because their wild cousins are so rare and elusive.
