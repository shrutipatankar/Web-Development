<h3> Canvas in html5</h3>
<p>
    I could not resolve by the deadline what was the error for the google places API. I plan to resolve it by
    next weekend and check in experiments based on dynamically fethcing restaurants names.
    <br />
    However, I started working on html5 canvas. I understood the difference between svg and canvas and how
    either can be useful for particular applications. 
    <br />
    I also fixed the references issue, where the reference links in my experiments would open in a new page.
    I tried to restructure the file system to separate out js and css and html files, however, there was some issue
    with the paths that I gave for source links that did not work, hence I had to revert back.
