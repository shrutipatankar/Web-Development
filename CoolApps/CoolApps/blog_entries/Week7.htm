<h3> Weather Forecasting!</h3>
<p>
    I have extended my experiment of weather forecast last week to accomodate the weather predicted 
    using geolocation. Further, I have also incorporated a map of the current location. Thereby, on
    a single page I have displayed data using google maps as well as weather forecast api.
    <br />
    Also, I implemented an image slider using z-index. I intend to use this image slider in my next experiments
    where I want to pull images from APIs and slide them one after the other.
