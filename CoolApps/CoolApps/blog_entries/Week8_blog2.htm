<h3> SVG tag in html5</h3>
<p>
    I tried working on fethcing restaurants based on geolocation using google places API.
    However, I could not work out the request denied error. While parallely working on that issue,
    I started exploring svg in html5 and how it can be used to easily draw shapes with different strokes.
    I even understood how a different order of the points provided while drawing a polygon may affect the shape
    of the polygon. I also studied how gradients can be provided in svg shapes.
    <br />
    Although I am not going to use svg in my project, it was nevertheless, a extremely fun and easy
    tag to be learned while exploring html5.
