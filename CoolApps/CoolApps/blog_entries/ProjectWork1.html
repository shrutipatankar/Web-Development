
<h3> Project: Home Page</h3>
<p>
    Finished working on the home page that I would be using in my project. So the idea is as below:
    <br />
    A person who wants to travel can check everything related to that place such as restaurants, places near by,
    weather, history of that place etc at one place.
    <br />
    The home page that I have currently worked on uses z index to flip between different images. I have tried this 
    out in my image slider experiment. The current home page has a menu at the top, some content telling exactly what
    the site is about. The page has been designed to adapt fluid flow too!
