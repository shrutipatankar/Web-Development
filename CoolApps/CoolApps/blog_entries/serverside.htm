<h3> My first ASP DOT Net server side scripting</h3>
<p>
    Although I am not sure where I may need server side scripting in my project for now,
    I just implemented a simple experiment using ASP DOT Net .aspx page to script for the server
    side. Implemented a simple Application that provides a message based on the age that is input.
    <br />
    I also validated both the fields. I html encoded the text field and validated data for the number field
    at server side!
