<p>
    It was a wonderful experience working for web development! My learning curve was very high in this subject and
    since it is of great interest to me, I am sure I will keep learning more and more and what I have learned so far
    will act as a sturdy base to what I will learn ahead. 
    <br />
    This week, I have completed the documentation for my project and have fixed some minor issues:
    <ul>
        <li>The temperature of the climate tab now appears in Ferenheit instead of Kelvin</li>
        <li>The map that can be opened by clicking the link of the address row in the data table now opens a new 
        map with center at the place being searched</li>
        <li>The images on home page now flip in infinite loop without using z-index</li>
        <li> I have tested the project thoroughly for any bugs and jotted them down as a part of documentation</li>
        <li> The images that i fetch on search page had a bug that made only the last image display but now I
        have fixed it by using z-index. Although I did give a try to implement this using Proessor Rasala's
        loadimagesfromurl javascript but was unsuccessful in doing so since that needs the url's to be
        stored in a file and I get my urls to images dynamically. I could not write to a file on server using
        javascript
        </li>
        <li>
            I asked few of my friends to check the functionality from different parts of the world.Thereby,
            this web application has been tested from Singapore, India and Costa Rica. Details added in testing 
            document.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have tested the project in IE 11,Safari Browser and Chrome. Test details added in documentation.
            Also, there is a UI related bug while using this in Mozilla Firefox which I am unable to resolve currently
            However, I am still working on it.
            Details added in the known bugs list
        </li>
        <li>
            The UI for Food filter tab has been enhanced with some CSS
        </li>
        <li>
            I have also made the CSS responsive and tested the application in Cell phones:
            iphone and 1+
        </li>
        <li>
            I have tested the links for all experiments. Two issues I detected were:
           <br />
            1. In the datapull experiment to pull movie details from IMDB server, the input field to enter
            movie name is not HTML encoded.
            <br />
            2. Same is the case for weather forecast experiment where the name of the city is taken as an input field.
            <br />
            Apart from that all the experiments have been tested for bugs and atleast I, did not find any.
            Note that while the project has been tested in different browsers, the experiments have been tested in Google
            Chrome.

    </ul>
