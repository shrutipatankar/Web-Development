
<h3> My JQuery and AJAX Week!</h3>
<p>
    I have tried using a seasons theme this week<br />

    This week I studied JQuery hovering effects and implemented the dynamic sub list on hovering over the main list.
    Also, I studied the animate function of jquery to understand the call back functionality as well as implemented
    the same. I also worked on adding css classes dynamically on a div in html. I studied the properties related to 
    setting of classes dynamically. This has been done in jQuery.

<br />
    Toward the end of my learning curve this week, I also studied on Ajax calls and read about its importance on setting
    the pages rather than reloding it. I worked on an experiment to pull data from IMDB movie database API.
