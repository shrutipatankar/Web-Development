<h3> Search Places Page</h3>
<p>
    From my home page one can navigate to Search Places tab.
    <br />
    This tab currently loactes the user's current position and displays the restaurants along with addresses
    of these restaurants.This is done using Google Places API. I have stored the key separately as asked by the 
    professor in a keys folder. Also, I have constructed the table based on the information I get from Google Places 
    API. The Project folder thereby contains a CSS folder, a javascript Folder and a images folder. Apart from this,
    the html pages that reside in the base folder.
    <br />
    I have provided the source file in home.html Source tab. Currently the source tab comprises of 5 pages:
    <ul>
        <li>home.html</li>
        <li>home.css</li>
        <li>SearchPlaces.html</li>
        <li>searchPlaces.css</li>
        <li>searchPlaces.js</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    The document page has not been constructed yet. Clicking on that will not take the user anywhere for now.
