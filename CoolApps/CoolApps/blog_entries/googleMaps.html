<h3> Explored Google Maps API!! </h3>
<p>
    I explored Google Maps API this week! Unlike the geolocation provided by html5, I understood the use of 
    google Maps API to explore the different types of Maps like TERRAIN, ROADMAP and SATELLITE that can be 
    shown using google maps api. Also how different zoom levels matter in getting a closer look or more 
    generalized look of a map. I have also explored how to set latitude and longitude to view a particular
    place on earth!
    <br />
    Apart from this, I have begun to develop my project home page. I also started correcting the hierarchy of
    the folders as asked by the TA. Currently, I have fixed it for Week 2 and Week 3 experiments. In coming weeks
    I will proceed to fix it for rest of the weeks as well. By fixing I mean that I have spearated out the CSS 
    scripts for corresponding html files for Week 2 and Week 3 to a css folder under the project.
