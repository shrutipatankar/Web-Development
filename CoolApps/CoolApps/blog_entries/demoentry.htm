
<h3> My First Week Experience</h3>
<p>
Hi! I have completed two CSS and two HTML Experiments this week!
In HTML I learned about content editable property that I can set to
    an HTML element. I also learned about adding audio files into my HTML.
    Currently I have created a form with audio clips next to each field, that
    provides instructions in Spanish language. These intructions guide through 
    to tell what data needs to be entered in the corresponding field.
    <br />
    In CSS, I have learned about the gradients that can be applied.
    Using this property I have created a sparkling circle.
    Also, I have learned to animate shapes in CSS. Image animation was 
    included in this as well. I have moved a cauldron towards a wizard using 
    this property. I learned about webkit development in this.
