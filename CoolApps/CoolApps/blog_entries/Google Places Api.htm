<h3> Explored Google Places API!! </h3>
<p>
    I explored Google Places API to display a map containing nearby restaurants based on the
    location of the person who is browsing. This particular experiment may be used in my project or 
    I may simply choose to display the current location of the user, will provide the user with options
    to view different types of maps and then based on the location will uses google places api to display
    list of restaurants with their pictures in tabular format.

    Fixed file hierarchy for Week 4 along with Week 2 and Week 3
