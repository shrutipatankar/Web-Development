
<h3> My Second Week Experience</h3>
<p>
    I have tried using a wild life theme this week.<br />

    This week was absolute fun learning Responsive CSS and HTML5 nav and section, article, 
    figcaption and fig tags.I implemented informative page with useful info and fun facts about different creatures.
    The implementation of jumping into the same page by using href tag is useful, handy and practical when I look at such
    an experiment!
    <br />
    iFrame implementation as well as implementation of tabbed interface using simple li tag
    left me awestruck!This week was overall an excellent learning curve! With this information I have built a small
    website to inform about how to identify one of the four poisonous snakes, and provided a short form to fill out
    information regarding spotting of a snake. This website is primarily built to avoid any danger to be caused to humans
    or snakes.
    <br />
    It was even more fun implementing CSS for getting a Magzine-like-look! I have picked some cool stories from
    national geographic official wesite and put it in my experiment in a pattern which looks like a magzine!
    I am now more aware of how powerful CSS is.
