<h3> Filtering using jQuery tutorial</h3>
<p>
    As I have used dances theme this week, I made two divisions in a page. One has information related to
     all the dances and another has buttons. Based on the type of dance you select using the button, I have displayed
    the information related to the dance types that fall under that categoery. This was done using filtering concepts
    of jQuery.<br />

    It was very evident that controlling the DOM elements and getting information of certain elements
    from the tree structure is an excellent way to render things that you want while avoiding other elements!
    This experiment was an eye opener!
