<h3>More jQuery!</h3>
<p>
    This week was spent to work and explore jQuery even more. I successfully implemented and understood the
    concepts of binding of elements with functions using jQuery, jQuery selectors and jQuery a common usage of
    preventing back button navigation from the browser. 
    <br />
    Also, I learned more about parseJSON and getJSON methods and clearly understood the meaning of
    accessing a json text and filtering it out as well as putting it into tabular format!
    <br />
    Great learning curve this week!
