
<h3> My first jQuery tutorial</h3>
<p>
    I have used a dances theme this week <br/>

    I have implemented today, a drop down menu using jQuery onhover of mouse over any of the main 
    menu items. I used w3schools.com primarily to study basic jquery. I learned how to create 
    menus and submenus. Initially, I have hidden the Sub menus. Only when the user hovers over the main 
    meu item, the submenu list appears from which he can select. Information of the same will be shown to
    him further as a part of this experiment.

    It was great exploring the powerful aspect of jQuery in my first experiment!
