       TERM:       SPRING 2015
       PROFESSOR:  RICHARD RASALA
       UNIVERSITY: NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY, BOSTON
       ALL THE IMAGES USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT RESIDE UNDER IMAGES FOLDER OF THE PROJECT FOLDER

       ABOUT PROJECT:

       This project has been created to help the travelers learn more about the place. I have used following APIs
       for this project:

       1. Places and Restaurants: Google Places API
       2. Maps: Google Maps API
       3. Weather: Open Weather API
       4. History: Wikipedia API 



      About Home Page: home.html

      This page resides as a static html page. This page simply displays images using z-index as I have tried in
      my image slider experiment. It displays menu at the top. I intend to document this project and have therefore
      provides a tab for that as well. Apart from that this page also explains the purpose of this project in short.
      
      This page has been made adaptive to change in the screen size by using fluid flow experiments concepts.

      Disclaimer: All the images used on this page have been downloaded from the web after checking for
      copyright sign. I am not the owner of the images. I intend to simply use the images for 
      developing this project as a part of my learning curve.
