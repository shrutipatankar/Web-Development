                ABOUT PROJECT:

                This project has been created to help the travelers learn more about the place. I have used following APIs
                for this project:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Places and Restaurants: Google Places API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Maps: Google Maps API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weather: Open Weather API
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                <div class="div-header">
                    Project Summary
                </div>

                    The project home page displays what the project si about. It provides some idea to what to expect out
                    of the project.
                    <br />
                    The search place page detects the location of the user. It is a single page app that shows restuarant data
                    near by the user by default. Details such as name of the place, address, rating and if the place is
                    open currently is shown to the user. Also, the address of the place appears as a hyperlink, which when
                    clicked takes user to a map locating the place in a new tab. The user may filter the food results based on
                    restaurant, bar, cafe and bakery.
                    <br />
                    Same features apply when the user is searching for places worth visting.
                    <br />
                    The climate tab shows the users the details of climate in his area. This is determined by latitude
                    and longitude of the user's current location from Open Weather API.
                    Note that the temperature is shown only in Faranheits.
                    <br />
                    Apart from these features, the user can see pictures of the place he searching in the frame beside the
                    map. The project has been made CSS responsive to allow cell phone users to see the data clearly.
                    The frame related to the pictures disappears completely though once the window is resized at a certain level
                    as the map then occupies the width of the screen completely.
