                I intend to modify this project, going ahead (probably over the summer), to enhance following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Along with the user being able to search about a place based on his location, the user
                        will be able to type any place in the World and be able to know the same details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, I intend to give a clickable link on name of the place, which will fetch the
                        reviews of the place and more details from Google Place Details API.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For climate, going ahead I want to provide detailed prediction for the whole day instead
                        of simply current details of climate.
                    </li>
                   
                </ol>
            </div>

        </div>
