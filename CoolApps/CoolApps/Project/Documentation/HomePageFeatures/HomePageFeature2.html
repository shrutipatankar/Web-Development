                The Responsive CSS feature has been added to the Home Page. This feature enables the 
                fluid flow of the content in this page. This code has been tested on Cell phones (iphone 4s and 1+)
                This feature auto sets the image width and the summary as the screen gets smaller and smaller.
                The top menu auto resets itself to occupy full width as shown in the third figure.
                Here, I have captured an image where the menu is very close to getting reset.
                Please view the source CSS for more details
