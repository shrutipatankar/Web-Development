                This feature has been added by using loadimages functionality provided by professor Rasala.
                In this I have used 10 images that keep flipping in a slide show one after the other with a delay
                of 3 seconds in between each image.
                This slide show goes on infinitely.
                This feature resides in the home page and has been done using javascript.
