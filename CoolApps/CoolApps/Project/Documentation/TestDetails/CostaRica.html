                Just for the purpose of testing, I have asked few of my friends scattered around the world to
                capture the screenshots of my project. This particular document has the test results from 
                Costa Rica!
                <br />
                Disclaimer: These screen shots were captured before some fixes. The main purpose of this document 
                is to show location based results. Kindly ignore CSS related bugs for this document.
                <br />
                My special thanks to Mr Rodolfo Zumbado,who is stationed in Costa Rica and conducted this testing for me.
