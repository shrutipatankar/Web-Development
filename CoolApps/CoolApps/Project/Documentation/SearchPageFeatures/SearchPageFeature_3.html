                The tab for I am Hungry! provides the user with following data
                <ul>
                    <li> Restaurants  </li>
                    <li> Cafe </li>
                    <li> Bakery</li>
                    <li> Bar</li>
                </ul>
                This tab shows data thats pulled from Google Places API.
                Each of the above mentioned filters allows user to see following details:
                <ul>
                    <li> Name</li>
                    <li> Address</li>
                    <li> Rating</li>
                    <li> If the resturant/cafe/bar/bakery is open currently</li>
                </ul>
                NOTE:
                <br />
                I am Hungry Tab actually shows the radio buttons to filter based on bar, cafe etc.
                This has been achieved refering to the radio button experiments as asked by professor Rasala.

                Since the data has been pulled from Google Places API, if the data related to the place being
                open now is not present, I have simply put "No Idea!"
                Similarly, if the data related to the rating is not present from the API, then I am displaying
                "NA".
                <br />
                Disclaimer: I am sorry for any inconvienience caused due to this. However, I cannot help this much 
                since the scope of this project is limited to pulling the data from Google Places API
