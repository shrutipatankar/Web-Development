                My deep apologies for not being able to get the history data of a place.
                I myself, am curious to know the history of the place that I visit. However,
                since for this project, I am pulling data from APIs and since I could not find a
                suitable API to pull this information from, I could not complete this part.

                <br>
                I am keeping this tab to try and find out in the near future if I can
                find it. If so, I intend to provide that information into Travel Diaries.
                <br />
                As shown in the above screenshot, the user will only be able to see a message
                from author apologizing.
