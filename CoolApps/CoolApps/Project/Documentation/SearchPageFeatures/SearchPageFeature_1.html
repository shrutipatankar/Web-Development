                This page precisely locates where the user is currently. Note that the accuracy of this 
                feature will depend on the device on which the user is connected (cell phones will provide
                 better accuracy in detecting where the user is currently).

                This feature displays a map which has been created with a marker at users current location.
                This feature has been implemented using Google Maps API.
