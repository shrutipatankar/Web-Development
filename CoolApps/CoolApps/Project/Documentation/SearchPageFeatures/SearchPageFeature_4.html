                The Places Worth Visting Tab searches for following places near by the user and provides the details:
                <ul>
                    <li>Museums</li>
                    <li>Amusement park</li>
                    <li>Aquarium</li>
                    <li>Art Gallery</li>
                    <li>Zoo</li>
                    <li>Shopping Mall</li>

                </ul>

                This tab shows data thats pulled from Google Places API.
                Each of the above mentioned filters allows user to see following details:
                <ul>
                    <li> Name</li>
                    <li> Address</li>
                    <li> Rating</li>
                    <li> If the place is open currently</li>
                </ul>
                NOTE:
                <br />
                Since the data has been pulled from Google Places API, if the data related to the place being
                open now is not present, I have simply put "No Idea!"
                Similarly, if the data related to the rating is not present from the API, then I am displaying
                "NA".
                <br />
                Disclaimer: I am sorry for any inconvienience caused due to this. However, I cannot help this much
                since the scope of this project is limited to pulling the data from Google Places API
