            <p>
                This experiment is to study new tags of html5. I studied the tags fig, figcaption, nav , header,footer,
                and section as well as artcile. This results into a better design as the browser knows what it is 
                expecting and how should that be rendered. Also, the navingation tag has been used here to navigate 
                freely between different article of the same page. This provides a free flow for user to jump to a
                particular article, rather than skimming through the whole page for the required article.

                            Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae. They are the largest land animals in the world.
                            They have the biggest brain (12 pounds), the thickest skin (1 inch) and the longest nose
                            (their trunk is about 8 feet). Their waistline is about 16 feet.
                            Elephants are herbivores. They eat grasses, tree foliage, bark, bamboo, shrubs, roots
                            and fruit. They also eat soil for its mineral content. They disperse undigested plant
                            seeds through their dung, helping to cultivate plants. Full-grown African elephants
                            will eat about 6 to 8 percent of their body weight in vegetation each day.
                            They spend an average of 18 hours per day feeding. Asian elephants require less
                            food because the food in their habitat is more diverse and of higher quality.
                            Elephants can drink 67 gallons of water a day. They will dig for water during a drought.

                            Starfish (sea stars) are beautiful animals that can be a variety of colors, shapes and sizes,
                            although all resemble a star. While some appear smooth, they all have spines covering their
                            upper surface and a soft underside. If you gently turn over a live sea star, you'll see its
                            tube feet wiggling back at you. These iconic marine animals are fascinating creatures.

                            <br />
                            Although sea stars live underwater and are commonly called "starfish," they are not fish.
                            They do not have gills, scales, or fins like fish do and they move quite differently from
                            fish. While fish propel themselves with their tails, sea stars have tiny tube feet to
                            help them move along

                            <br />
                            While the five-armed varieties of sea star are the most well known, not all sea stars have
                            5 arms. Some have many more. Take the sun star for instance, which has up to 40 arms!
                            nstead of blood, sea stars have a water vascular system, in which the sea star pumps sea
                            water through its sieve plate, or madreporite, into its tube feet to extend them. Muscles
                            within the tube feet retract them.

                            <br />
                            While they can't see as well as we do, sea stars have an eye spot at the end of each arm.
                            This is a very simple eye that looks like a red spot. The eye doesn't see much detail,
                            but can sense light and dark.

                            These famous pink birds can be found in warm, watery regions on
                            many continents. They favor environments like estuaries and saline or alkaline lakes.
                            Considering their appearance, flamingos are surprisingly fluid swimmers, but really
                            thrive on the extensive mud flats where they breed and feed.
                            Greater flamingos are likely to be the only tall, pink bird in any given locale.
                            They also have long, lean, curved necks and black-tipped bills with a distinctive downward bend.
                            Their bent bills allow them to feed on small organisms—plankton, tiny fish,
                            fly larvae, and the like. In muddy flats or shallow water, they use their long legs
                            and webbed feet to stir up the bottom. They then bury their bills, or even their entire
                            heads, and suck up both mud and water to access the tasty morsels within.
                            A flamingo's beak has a filterlike structure to remove food from the water
                            before the liquid is expelled.
                            <br />
                            Shrimplike crustaceans are responsible for the flamingo's pink color.
                            The birds pale in captivity unless their diet is supplemented.

                            Lion tamarins take their name from their impressive manes—thick rings of hair reminiscent of
                            Africa's great cats. The golden lion tamarin may be the most beautiful of the four lion tamarin
                            species. Its abundant golden hair frames a charismatic black face and covers its small body and tail.
                            Despite their name, these rare primates have far more in common with their monkey relatives than any feline.

                            The golden lion tamarin forms social family groups.
                            Males help to raise their offspring, and often carry their young on their backs in between feedings.
                            Tamarin young are usually twins.

                            Golden lions live primarily in the trees. They sleep in hollows at night
                            and forage by day while traveling from branch to branch. Long fingers help
                            them stay aloft and snare insects, fruit, lizards, and birds.

                            These interesting animals are critically endangered, as are many of the forests
                            in which they live. Brazil's Atlantic coastal rain forests are disappearing due
                            to ever-expanding logging, agriculture, and industry, and unfortunately,
                            the golden lion tamarin is in danger of vanishing with them.

                            The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. A typical animal eats half
                            the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day.
                            It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary
                            needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather
                            like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

                            Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China.
                            They may climb
                            as high as 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.

                            Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture.
                            They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers
                            and efficient swimmers.

                            Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense
                            of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring.
                            After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two.
                            The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces (142 grams) at birth and cannot
                            crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white,
                            and develop their much loved coloring later.

                            There are only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild.
                            Perhaps 100 pandas live in zoos, where they are always among
                            the most popular attractions. Much of what we know about pandas comes
                            from study of these zoo animals, because their wild cousins are so rare and elusive.
